## 𑣲⋆｡˚Overview
ScholarChain is a console-based C++ application that simulates a **scholarship allocation system** using queueing and blockchain-inspired data structures.  
<br/><br/>
It demonstrates the practical use of **data structures and algorithms**, including stacks, queues, and priority queues, alongside recursion and iteration for efficient processing.
<br/>
### Users can:
🎓 Apply for scholarships  
📊 View ranked applicants  
⚖️ Process applicants fairly  
📋 Manage waitlisted entries  

### Data Handling
💾 Applicant records are processed and stored using structured data systems.

## 𑣲⋆｡˚Features
1. **Applicant Evaluation.** Assesses eligibility based on academic and financial criteria  
2. **Priority Ranking.** Uses priority queue for fair distribution  
3. **Queue System.** Processes applicants in FIFO order  
4. **Blockchain Record.** Stores approved applicants chronologically  
5. **Budget Allocation.** Allocates funds until limit is reached  
6. **Waitlist System.** Handles overflow applicants

## 𑣲⋆｡˚How to Run the Program
Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
g++ main.cpp queue.cpp priority.cpp stack.cpp hashing.cpp network.cpp -o dsa
```

Run the program using:

```bash
./dsa
```

- `main.cpp` - Entry point of the program; handles user interaction and system flow  
- `.gitignore` - Specifies files to be ignored by Git  

### 📂 Data Structure
- `queue.cpp` - Handles normal applicant processing (FIFO)  
- `priority.cpp` - Manages high-priority applicants  
- `stack.cpp` - Stores blockchain-like records  

### 📂 Integrity
- `hashing.cpp` - Ensures data integrity using hashing techniques  
- `network.cpp` - Simulates blockchain network validation/consensus
